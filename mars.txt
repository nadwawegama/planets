story of the world is quite the same, we all live for one another in different wolrd
the ground is very soft
the two moons are confusing for the wolfman
bu the mummy will appriciate the lack of humidity
mars is red, difficult to breath
no tress grow in mars, i dont know much about mars to write anything more
